sencha-basic-xml-parser
=======================

This is a very basic xml parser created in sencha touch 2 . The motivation is to learn the workings of Sencha and get into a bit of advanced coding using the same. 

To use the code, just install a web server (if you dont have one running ) and copy the folder to the root of the server and then access the folder via browser. You should see the Application up and running in the browser. The code is dirty and has bugs because it is created just for learning purposes only . The view is not coded and the output is thrown to the console of the browser. 

The parser Functions :

The xml document that it parses is in the data folder.
Any change to the xml will imply that the code has to be changed as well, or else the app will crash
The parsed output is not attached to a view . It is just output to the console of the browser. 

Used Technologies : 
1. Sencha CMD 
2. Secnha Touch framework 
3. Wamp server 
4. Sublime text editor
5. Win 8.1 Pro x64
